Introduction to Aether
------------------------

Aether is geared towards a themer that utilizes sass/compass, it also aims to provide theme settings
for tasks better handled on the Drupal theme layer, such as grid column sizes per region 

This theme is a starter theme, with all the components you should need to build a fixed-width responsive site using re-usable CSS patterns, it supports (out of the box) Handheld Portrait (320px), Handheld Landscape, Tablet Landscape, Tablet Portrait, & Desktop (1140px).

Installation of theme on Drupal 7
------------------------

- Download Aether from https://github.com/krisbulman/Aether
- Unpack the downloaded file and place the Aether folder in your Drupal installation under 
  one of the following locations:

    * sites/all/themes
    * sites/default/themes
    * sites/example.com/themes 

- Log in as an administrator on your Drupal site and go to 
  /Appearance (admin/appearance) and make Aether the default theme.
